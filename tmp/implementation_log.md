# Pure LLM Architecture Implementation Log

## Branch: pure-llm-architecture

### Goal
Implement a lean, pure LLM-driven multi-agent system for studying emergent collusion behavior without any rule-based components.

### Key Changes
1. Create universal LLMAgent class with instance-based memory and strategy
2. Implement event-based communication system
3. Build hierarchical oversight through agent composition
4. Remove all heuristics and rule-based logic
5. Use Fireworks AI with DeepSeek-R1 model

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Create Core LLMAgent Class
- Self-contained agents with private memory
- Role-based behavior (trader, referee, governor)
- Event-driven communication

#### Step 2: Event Bus System
- Simple publish/subscribe pattern
- All actions are events
- Agents subscribe based on their role

#### Step 3: Minimal Market Environment
- Only tracks state
- No hardcoded dynamics
- LLM determines all outcomes

#### Step 4: Clean Up
- Remove all rule-based files
- Consolidate into minimal codebase
