# Pure LLM Architecture Implementation Log

## Branch: pure-llm-architecture

### Goal
Implement a lean, pure LLM-driven multi-agent system for studying emergent collusion behavior without any rule-based components.

### Key Changes
1. Create universal LLMAgent class with instance-based memory and strategy
2. Implement event-based communication system
3. Build hierarchical oversight through agent composition
4. Remove all heuristics and rule-based logic
5. Use Fireworks AI with DeepSeek-R1 model

### Implementation Complete ✅

#### What Was Built

1. **LLMAgent** (`llm_agent.py` - 141 lines)
   - Universal agent class for traders, referees, and governors
   - Private memory and thoughts
   - Role-based system prompts
   - Connects to Fireworks AI / DeepSeek-R1

2. **EventBus** (`event_bus.py` - 78 lines)
   - Publish/subscribe event system
   - Complete decoupling of agents
   - Full audit trail of all events

3. **SimpleMarket** (`simple_market.py` - 86 lines)
   - Minimal state tracking
   - No market rules
   - Posts events for all actions

4. **MarketOrchestrator** (`orchestrator.py` - 180 lines)
   - Creates agent ecosystem
   - Manages three-phase rounds (trade → assess → govern)
   - Builds natural hierarchy

5. **Runner** (`run_pure_llm.py` - 107 lines)
   - Clean experiment runner
   - Saves complete interaction logs
   - Shows emergent behaviors

### Results

- **Code Reduction**: 57% fewer lines (1366 → 592)
- **Complexity**: Moved from code to prompts
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify behaviors
- **Purity**: True emergent behavior testing

### Next Steps

1. Run experiments with DeepSeek-R1 to observe emergent collusion
2. Analyze communication patterns that develop
3. Test different agent personalities
4. Compare collusion emergence across different LLM models

### Key Insight

By removing ALL rules and heuristics, we can now study what LLMs actually do when given freedom to develop their own strategies. The hierarchical oversight emerges naturally from agent roles, not from hardcoded logic.
